      <h2>Batu Caves</h2>
      <p>
        Batu Caves (Tamil: பத்து மலை, romanized: Pattumalai) is a mogote (a type
        of karst landform) that has a series of caves and cave temples in
        Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia. It takes its name from the Malay word batu,
        meaning 'rock'. The hill was originally known as Kapal Tanggang from the
        legend of Si Tanggang. The town nearby is named after the Batu Caves
        limestone formation. The cave is one of the most popular Hindu shrines
        outside India, and is dedicated to Murugan. It is the focal point of the
        Tamil festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia. Batu Caves in short also
        referred as 10th Caves or Hill for Murugan as there are six important
        holy shrines in India and four more in Malaysia. The three others in
        Malaysia are Kallumalai Temple in Ipoh, Tanneermalai Temple in Penang
        and Sannasimalai Temple in Malacca.
